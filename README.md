# python-data-analysis-basics
Exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset using Python and pandas; includes basic statistics, group-wise aggregation, and visualization.

This repository demonstrates basic data analysis using Python and pandas on the Iris dataset. 
It covers beginner-to-intermediate tasks including data loading, summary statistics, 
grouping by species, and visualizing distributions.

## Files

- `iris-analysis.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook performing the analysis.
- `results/` : Contains screenshots of plots generated from the analysis.
- `README.md` : This file.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Loading and inspecting datasets using pandas
- Descriptive statistics (`describe()`, `shape`, `info()`)
- Group-wise aggregation using `groupby()`
- Simple visualization using matplotlib
- Basic use of Jupyter notebooks and GitHub for version control

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `iris-analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the results and plots.
